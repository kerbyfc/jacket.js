Jacket.js 
=========

  ***dress up your classes, function and object to Jackets***

How much we need the callstack when an error occurs at the front? I want it badly...
I dont want to wrap each method of my classes in try/catch to handle stacktrace, I want to wrap whole class and rid myself from this boring work.
That's why the Jacket was appeared.

##### What functionality does it give?

1. Handling exceptions, raised in function or in methods of function instance
2. Notify your server about exceptions
3. Calling a specific callback on each wrapped function call
4. ... (I have no time, I'll continue later)
